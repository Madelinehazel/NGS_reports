Autosomal_recessive,"Homozygous alternate in proband, not on X chromosome",,
Compound_heterozygous,Heterzygous alternate in proband in a gene with burden >= 2 (note that these may not be true compound hets; we would need parental genotypes to verify),,
Hemizygous,Homozygous alternate in proband on X chromosome,,
Dominant_OMIM,All heterozygous alternate variants in the proband that fall in genes associated with OMIM disease.,,
Dominant_nonOMIM,Heterozygous alternate variants in the proband that do not fall in genes associated with OMIM disease. pLI >=0.95. ,,
